# `Shuffile Links` üìÇ

**Note**: Shuffile only supports desktop as of now.

**Desclaimer**: This is a feature addon to the original project [**Shuffile**](https://github.com/raghav-karn/shuffile), maintaining a seperate repository to de-clutter Shuffile repository.

## Overview ‚ú®
This is **Shuffile Links**, a feature added to [**Shuffile**](https://github.com/raghav-karn/shuffile) to generate and share password-protected files as links.

## How I managed to pull this off üìÉ
> Shuffile Share required the knowledge of NodeJS, MongoDB (mongoose library), express libary, multer library and hashing using bcrypt library amonst others.

Here is how I managed to do this:
- Used express to handle files
- Created a file storing system using mongoose
- Wrote frontend in EJS (first time with it)
- Used bcrypt for hashing passwords
- Fitted into the Shuffile-esque design

## The fun part ‚Äî Making things work! üòã
> It was fun to actually see each and every thing just work out ‚Äî from creating links to adding password protection.

## The rough part ‚Äî Designing¬° üéä
> Designing to meet the design of Shuffile was a clear pain. The biggest pain was customizing the inputs, especially the file input. I wished to make it look like one of Shuffile Send but that didn't work out as planned, so I sorted to customizing the colors and fonts only. Also, I still can't change the width of inputs to be larger. Also, linking to `public/style.css` showed a MIME error, idk.
